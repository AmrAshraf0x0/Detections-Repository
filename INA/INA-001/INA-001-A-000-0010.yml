title: Multiple Failed Login Attempts Followed by Successful Authentication - Linux - INA-001-A-000-0010
id: INA-001-A-000-0010
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects multiple failed Linux SSH authentication attempts followed by a successful SSH authentication for the same user and source IP within 5 minutes.
  Implemented as a Sigma correlation rule referencing shared base rules in BASE/.

  Status:
  experimental

  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1110 - Brute Force, T1078 - Valid Accounts
  Kill Chain Phase: Initial Access

  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Authentication Logs
  Product targeted by the Rule: Linux
  Service in the product that provides the log: auth

  Detection Logic:
  Ordered correlation: SSH failure then SSH success, grouped by user.name and source.ip, timespan 5m.

  False Positive Considerations:
  Typo then success; legitimate admin testing.

  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: High
