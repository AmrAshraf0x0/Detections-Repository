description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects interactive logons (console/RDP/cached) performed by accounts that match common service-account naming patterns.
  Service accounts should rarely authenticate interactively; this can indicate credential theft or misuse.

  Status:
  experimental

  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1078 - Valid Accounts
  Kill Chain Phase: Initial Access

  Data Sources:
