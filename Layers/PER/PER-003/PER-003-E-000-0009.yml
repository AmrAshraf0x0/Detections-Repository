      Detection Description:
      Detects remote job scheduling with at.exe targeting a remote host (\\HOST), often used for lateral movement and persistence.

      Status:
      experimental

      Threat Mapping:
      MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1053.002 - At, T1021 - Remote Services
      Kill Chain Phase: Persistence

      Data Sources:
      MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
      Product targeted by the Rule: Windows
      Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon (Event ID 1) or equivalent

      Detection Logic:
      at.exe command line contains a remote host specification (\\).

      False Positive Considerations:
      Rare; legitimate remote administration on legacy systems.

      Severity and Risk Rating:
      Severity Level: High
