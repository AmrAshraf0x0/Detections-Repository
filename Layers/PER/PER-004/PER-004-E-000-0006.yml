      Detection Description:
      Detects Office applications creating services by spawning sc.exe or PowerShell New-Service, which is highly suspicious and may indicate macro-driven persistence.

      Status:
      experimental

      Threat Mapping:
      MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1543.003 - Windows Service, T1137 - Office Application Startup
      Kill Chain Phase: Persistence

      Data Sources:
      MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
      Product targeted by the Rule: Windows
      Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon (Event ID 1) or equivalent

      Detection Logic:
      Office parent process spawning sc.exe or PowerShell with service-creation commands.

      False Positive Considerations:
      Very rare; investigate if triggered.

      Severity and Risk Rating:
      Severity Level: High
