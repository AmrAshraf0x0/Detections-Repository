title: Driver Loaded from Temp Directory - PER-007-E-000-0008
id: PER-007-E-000-0008
status: experimental
description: |
      Detection Description:
      Detects kernel driver load events where the driver is loaded from a temporary directory, which is suspicious for malicious drivers.

      Status:
      experimental

      Threat Mapping:
      MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1014 - Rootkit
      Kill Chain Phase: Persistence

      Data Sources:
      MITRE Data Source: Driver Load
      Product targeted by the Rule: Windows
      Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon (Event ID 6) if enabled

      Detection Logic:
      Sysmon Event ID 6 (Driver loaded) where ImageLoaded path contains Temp or other user-writable locations.

      False Positive Considerations:
      Rare; some installers may load drivers from temp during install (validate).

      Severity and Risk Rating:
      Severity Level: High

      References:
