title: Multiple Failed Login Attempts Followed by Successful Authentication - Windows - INA-001-A-000-0002
id: INA-001-A-000-0002
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects multiple failed Windows logon attempts followed by a successful logon for the same user and source IP within 5 minutes.
  Implemented as a Sigma correlation rule referencing shared base rules in BASE/.

  Status:
  experimental

  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1110 - Brute Force, T1078 - Valid Accounts
  Kill Chain Phase: Initial Access

  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Authentication Logs
  Product targeted by the Rule: Windows
  Service in the product that provides the log: Security

  Detection Logic:
  Ordered correlation: failed (4625) then success (4624), grouped by TargetUserName and IpAddress, timespan 5m.

  False Positive Considerations:
  User typos then success; credential rotation edge cases.

  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: High
