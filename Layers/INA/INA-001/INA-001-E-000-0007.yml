title: Same Account Authenticating to Multiple Hosts In small time frame - INA-001-E-000-0007
id: INA-001-E-000-0007
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects a single account authenticating successfully to multiple distinct destination hosts within 10 minutes.
  Implemented as a Sigma correlation rule (value_count) referencing a shared base rule in BASE/.

  Status:
  experimental

  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1078 - Valid Accounts
  Kill Chain Phase: Initial Access

  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Authentication Logs
  Product targeted by the Rule: Active Directory / Windows Authentication
  Service in the product that provides the log: Security

  Detection Logic:
  value_count correlation over ComputerName grouped by TargetUserName, timespan 10m, threshold >= 5.

  False Positive Considerations:
  Jump servers/bastions; patching tools; automation/orchestration accounts; monitoring tools.

  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: High
