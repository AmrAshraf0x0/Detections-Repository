      Detection Description:
      Detects creation of a kernel driver service using sc.exe, which can install a driver for persistence and privilege.

      Status:
      experimental

      Threat Mapping:
      MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1543.003 - Windows Service (Driver as service)
      Kill Chain Phase: Persistence

      Data Sources:
      MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
      Product targeted by the Rule: Windows
      Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon (Event ID 1) or equivalent

      Detection Logic:
      sc.exe create with 'type= kernel' or 'type= driver' parameters.

      False Positive Considerations:
      Legitimate driver installation tools.

      Severity and Risk Rating:
      Severity Level: High
