title: Service Executable Runs from Network Share - PER-004-E-000-0007
id: PER-004-E-000-0007
status: experimental
description: |
      Detection Description:
      Detects newly installed services whose ImagePath points to a UNC network share, which can indicate remote-hosted payload execution.

      Status:
      experimental

      Threat Mapping:
      MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1543.003 - Windows Service
      Kill Chain Phase: Persistence

      Data Sources:
      MITRE Data Source: Service Creation
      Product targeted by the Rule: Windows
      Service in the product that provides the log: System (7045) or Security (4697)

      Detection Logic:
      Service installation event where the service binary path begins with \\ (UNC).

      False Positive Considerations:
      Rare; some enterprise software may run from shares (should be reviewed).

      Severity and Risk Rating:
      Severity Level: High
