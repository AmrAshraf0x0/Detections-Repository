title: Systemd Service File Creation in Non-Standard Directories - PER-004-E-000-0009
id: PER-004-E-000-0009
status: experimental
description: |
      Detection Description:
      Detects creation of systemd service unit files in non-standard or user-writable directories, which can indicate persistence.

      Status:
      experimental

      Threat Mapping:
      MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1543.002 - Systemd Service
      Kill Chain Phase: Persistence

      Data Sources:
      MITRE Data Source: File Creation
      Product targeted by the Rule: Linux
      Service in the product that provides the log: auditd

      Detection Logic:
      File creation events for *.service under suspicious directories such as /tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm, /home, /run/user.

      False Positive Considerations:
      Rare; legitimate troubleshooting may create temporary unit files (review and allowlist).

      Severity and Risk Rating:
      Severity Level: High

      References:
