title: SSH Key Added by Bash/Cat Command - PER-005-E-000-0006
id: PER-005-E-000-0006
status: experimental
description: |
      Detection Description:
      Detects creation or modification of SSH authorized_keys using bash/cat/echo, which can establish persistent access.

      Status:
      experimental

      Threat Mapping:
      MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1098.004 - SSH Authorized Keys
      Kill Chain Phase: Persistence

      Data Sources:
      MITRE Data Source: File Modification; Process Creation
      Product targeted by the Rule: Linux
      Service in the product that provides the log: auditd

      Detection Logic:
      Writes to authorized_keys file or use of cat/echo redirection in command line. This rule flags file events for authorized_keys.
