id: PER-008-E-000-0001
status: experimental
description: |
      Detection Description:
      Detects creation of WMI event filters, which are used in WMI permanent event subscriptions for persistence.

      Status:
      experimental

      Threat Mapping:
      MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1546.003 - Event Triggered Execution: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription
      Kill Chain Phase: Persistence

      Data Sources:
      MITRE Data Source: WMI
      Product targeted by the Rule: Windows
      Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon (Event ID 19) if enabled

      Detection Logic:
      Sysmon Event ID 19 indicates a WMI Event Filter was created.

      False Positive Considerations:
      Legitimate monitoring/management solutions that use WMI subscriptions.
