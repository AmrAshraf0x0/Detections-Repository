title: Certutil Base64 Decode - DFE-006-E-000-0025
id: DFE-006-E-000-0025
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects certutil being used to decode base64-encoded content, which can be used to reconstruct payloads on disk.
  
  Status:
  experimental
  
  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information; T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution (Certutil)
  Kill Chain Phase: Defense Evasion
  
  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
  Product targeted by the Rule: Windows Servers (Sysmon)
  Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon
  
  Detection Logic:
  Sysmon process creation (EventID 1) where certutil.exe is executed with -decode or -decodehex.
  
  False Positive Considerations:
  Legitimate certificate/PKI utilities decoding content.
  
  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: medium
