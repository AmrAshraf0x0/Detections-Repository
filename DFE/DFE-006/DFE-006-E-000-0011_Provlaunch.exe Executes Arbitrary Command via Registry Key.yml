title: Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key - DFE-006-E-000-0011
id: DFE-006-E-000-0011
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects provlaunch.exe being invoked to run provisioning commands that can be staged in registry (Provisioning\Commands), enabling proxy execution.
  
  Status:
  experimental
  
  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution
  Kill Chain Phase: Defense Evasion
  
  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
  Product targeted by the Rule: Windows Servers (Sysmon)
  Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon
  
  Detection Logic:
  Sysmon process creation (EventID 1) where provlaunch.exe executes with /RunProv (or /RunProv64) to run provisioning commands.
  
  False Positive Considerations:
  Legitimate provisioning/MDM tooling invoking provlaunch (e.g., OEM provisioning).
  
  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: high
