  Status:
  experimental
  
  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution (Print); T1564.004 - Hide Artifacts: NTFS File Attributes / ADS
  Kill Chain Phase: Defense Evasion
  
  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
  Product targeted by the Rule: Windows Servers (Sysmon)
  Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon
  
  Detection Logic:
  Sysmon process creation (EventID 1) where print.exe is used with /D: and the destination path matches ADS-style syntax (extension followed by colon).
  
  False Positive Considerations:
  Very rare; some legacy printing scripts (validate).
  
  Severity and Risk Rating:
