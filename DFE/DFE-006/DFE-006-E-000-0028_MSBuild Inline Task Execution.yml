title: MSBuild Inline Task Execution - DFE-006-E-000-0028
id: DFE-006-E-000-0028
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects msbuild executing project files from user-writable locations, commonly used for inline task execution as a LOLBin.
  
  Status:
  experimental
  
  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution (MSBuild)
  Kill Chain Phase: Defense Evasion
  
  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
  Product targeted by the Rule: Windows Servers (Sysmon)
  Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon
  
  Detection Logic:
  Sysmon process creation (EventID 1) where msbuild.exe executes a .csproj/.xml from user-writable paths.
  
  False Positive Considerations:
  Developer/build agent activity executing MSBuild from source directories.
  
  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: medium
