title: Msiexec Quiet Install from Remote Share - DFE-006-E-000-0021
id: DFE-006-E-000-0021
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects msiexec performing a quiet install from a remote share/UNC path, a technique used to stage and execute payloads.
  
  Status:
  experimental
  
  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution (Msiexec)
  Kill Chain Phase: Defense Evasion
  
  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
  Product targeted by the Rule: Windows Servers (Sysmon)
  Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon
  
  Detection Logic:
  Sysmon process creation (EventID 1) where msiexec.exe command line contains a UNC path and quiet/silent switches.
  
  False Positive Considerations:
  Legitimate remote software deployment tools using MSI from network shares.
  
  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: medium
