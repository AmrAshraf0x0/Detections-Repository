title: Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution - DFE-006-E-000-0006
id: DFE-006-E-000-0006
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe being executed with workflow files from user-writable locations, which can indicate LOLBin-based payload execution.
  
  Status:
  experimental
  
  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution
  Kill Chain Phase: Defense Evasion
  
  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
  Product targeted by the Rule: Windows Servers (Sysmon)
  Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon
  
  Detection Logic:
  Sysmon process creation (EventID 1) where Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe is executed and the command line references workflow files (.xoml/.xml) in user-writable paths.
  
  False Positive Considerations:
  Rare; legitimate workflow compilation by developers/build agents.
  
  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: high
