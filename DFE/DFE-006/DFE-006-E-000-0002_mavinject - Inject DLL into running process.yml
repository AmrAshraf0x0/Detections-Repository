title: mavinject - Inject DLL into running process - DFE-006-E-000-0002
id: DFE-006-E-000-0002
status: experimental
description: |
  Detection Description:
  Detects use of mavinject.exe to inject a DLL into an existing process. This can be used for stealthy code injection and defense evasion.
  
  Status:
  experimental
  
  Threat Mapping:
  MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s): T1055 - Process Injection; T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution
  Kill Chain Phase: Defense Evasion
  
  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
  Product targeted by the Rule: Windows Servers (Sysmon)
  Service in the product that provides the log: Sysmon
  
  Detection Logic:
  Sysmon process creation (EventID 1) where mavinject.exe is executed with the `/INJECTRUNNING` parameter and a DLL path. For the ADS variant, the DLL argument matches an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) style path (e.g., `file.txt:payload.dll`).
  
  False Positive Considerations:
  Rare; may occur during specialized debugging or application virtualization tooling.
  
  Severity and Risk Rating:
  Severity Level: high
