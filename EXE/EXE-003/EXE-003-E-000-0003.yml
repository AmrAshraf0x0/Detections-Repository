  Kill Chain Phase: Execution

  Data Sources:
  MITRE Data Source: Process Creation
  Product targeted by the Rule: Linux
  Service in the product that provides the log: auditd / syslog process execution (as ingested to SIEM)

  Detection Logic:
  Matches Linux process creation events where cron/crond is the parent and the executed file path is in /tmp, /dev/shm, /var/tmp, or other user-writable locations.

  False Positive Considerations:
  See falsepositives section below.

  Severity and Risk Rating:
