title: Kerberoasting Activity - Initial Query
status: test
description: |
    This rule will collect the data needed to start looking into possible kerberoasting activity.
    Further analysis or computation within the query is needed focusing on requests from one specific host/IP towards multiple service names within a time period of 5 seconds.
    You can then set a threshold for the number of requests and time between the requests to turn this into an alert.
