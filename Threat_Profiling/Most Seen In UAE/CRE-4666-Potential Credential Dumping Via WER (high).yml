            # Example: C:\Windows\system32\Werfault.exe -u -p 744 -ip 1112 -s 244
            # If the source process is not equal to the target process and the target process is LSASS then this is an indication of this technique
            # Example: If the "-p" points the PID of "lsass.exe" and "-ip" points to a different process than "lsass.exe" then this is a sign of malicious activity

    filter_lsass:

    condition: all of selection_* and not 1 of filter_*
falsepositives:
    - Windows Error Reporting might produce similar behavior. In that case, check the PID associated with the "-p" parameter in the CommandLine.
