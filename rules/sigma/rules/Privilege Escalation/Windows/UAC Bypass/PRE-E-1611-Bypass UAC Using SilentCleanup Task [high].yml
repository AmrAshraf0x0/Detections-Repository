title: Bypass UAC Using SilentCleanup Task
status: Experimental
description: |
    Detects the setting of the environement variable "windir" to a non default value.
    Attackers often abuse this variable in order to trigger a UAC bypass via the "SilentCleanup" task.
    The SilentCleanup task located in %windir%\system32\cleanmgr.exe is an auto-elevated task that can be abused to elevate any file with administrator privileges without prompting UAC.
